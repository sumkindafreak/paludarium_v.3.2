🌿 Smart Paludarium Controller - Nature's Perfect Ecosystem
Transform any terrarium into a self-sustaining tropical paradise with intelligent automation that mimics natural rainforest cycles.
What It Does
Your Smart Paludarium Controller creates and maintains the perfect environment for tropical plants, amphibians, and aquatic life by automatically managing seven essential systems:
🌧️ Rain System - Triggers gentle rainfall at dawn (8am) and dusk (8pm), plus emergency watering when water levels drop low
🏔️ Waterfall - Creates natural flowing water features that pulse randomly for 2 hours after each rain cycle, just like nature
🫧 Air Bubbles - Maintains healthy water oxygenation with smart 50-minute on/10-minute off cycles during active hours
🌫️ Misting - Delivers humidity bursts at noon and evening, plus automatic misting when humidity drops below your target level
🔥 Climate Control - Intelligent heating and cooling with customizable temperature ranges and hysteresis control to prevent rapid cycling
💡 LED Lighting - Simulates natural sunrise/sunset cycles with configurable daylight hours (default 8am-8pm)
📊 Environmental Monitoring - Continuously tracks water temperature, air temperature, humidity, light levels, and water depth
